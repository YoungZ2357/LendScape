# LendScape

A peer-to-peer lending and rental platform that connects people who want to lend items with those who need to borrow them.

## Overview

LendScape is a community-driven marketplace that makes it easy and safe to share resources. Instead of buying items you'll only use occasionally, you can borrow them from neighbors and local community members. Item owners can share things they're not using, while borrowers save money and reduce waste.

The platform handles the entire rental process - from browsing and booking to reviews - creating a trusted environment for peer-to-peer transactions.
